# (WIP) Analyze and report data for the HR Team.md

## üìå 1 Overview

In this project I will analyze a dataset with HR-related data from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adityaab1407/employee-productivity-and-satisfaction-hr-data?resource=download). This comprehensive dataset, "Employee Performance and Satisfaction Metrics Dataset", provides a holistic view of the workforce in an organization. It comprises various employee attributes, performance metrics, and job characteristics, enabling a wide range of analyses in the realm of Human Resources.

On this ocassion, I will use Google Sheets to analyze the data and create a report with answers to several questions posed by a potential HR Officer.

## 3 Questions

1. Can you provide some basic figures on the amount of employees, their age and gender distribution? 

2. How many hires did the company register per year?

3. Can you provide an interactive dashboard with the average salary per department and position? As well as the average salary per gender and other relevant figures? 
   
4. Is salary related to seniority? and to productivity? 

5. Can you provide an interactive dashboard with all relevant information per department? Including their productivity, projects and the productivity of their top 5 employees. 


## 4 Report

This is the [final report in Looker Studio](https://lookerstudio.google.com/u/1/reporting/2272b48c-ed1b-481e-ad8e-7d390f9a20ec/page/7dw6D)

This is [the spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Cy4XFhKRKTo6p3pu8g6XY3DOw66rmRvK3r3ZjNHQ9GU/edit?gid=760557872#gid=760557872) where I cleaned and formated the data. I also add columns and calculations to the original spreadsheet here.

## 5 Insights 

The company counts with 200 individuals, 50% male and 50% female, with an age average of 35 y/o. The company has been hiring exponentially since 1998 with a major increase in 2018. Every position counts with a similar amount of male and female employees, with a small discrepancy of 3-4 employees on average. 


The salary distribution per position seems to follow a logical allocation with those senior roles gaining more compared to those junior ones.					

Between 1998 and 2012, the correlation between seniority and salary is sometimes unclear with certain outliers. Those who joined in the late 90s/early 2000, earn slightly more than those who joined from 2008 onwards. However, the difference is very subtle.

We could also find certain outliers worth studying in years 2003, 2004, and 2007. With those hired on those years earning well below employees hired after 2008.

From 2013 onwards there seems to be a clearer correlation between seniority and salary, with newer employees earning less than older employees."
