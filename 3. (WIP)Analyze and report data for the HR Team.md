# (WIP) Analyze and report data for the HR Team.md

## üìå 1 Overview

In this project I will analyze a dataset with HR-related data from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adityaab1407/employee-productivity-and-satisfaction-hr-data?resource=download). This comprehensive dataset, "Employee Performance and Satisfaction Metrics Dataset", provides a holistic view of the workforce in an organization. It comprises various employee attributes, performance metrics, and job characteristics, enabling a wide range of analyses in the realm of Human Resources.

On this ocassion, I will use Google Sheets to analyze the data and create a report with answers to several questions posed by a potential HR Officer. 

This is the original dataset without edits

This is the final version of it, with all calculations and the report, also available at the end. 

## 5 Insights 

The salary distribution per position seems to follow a logical allocation with those senior roles gaining more compared to those junior ones.					

Between 1998 and 2012, the correlation between seniority and salary is sometimes unclear with certain outliers. Those who joined in the late 90s/early 2000, earn slightly more than those who joined from 2008 onwards. However, the difference is very subtle.

We could also find certain outliers worth studying in years 2003, 2004, and 2007. With those hired on those years earning well below employees hired after 2008.

From 2013 onwards there seems to be a clearer correlation between seniority and salary, with newer employees earning less than older employees."
