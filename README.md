# Portfolio-Alejandro

This repository provides several projects I completed using SQL and other tools, it includes the following:

 Project Name  | Description   |  Topic
------------- | ------------- | ------------------
[Analyze digital media store data](https://github.com/alexalra/Portfolio-Alejandro/blob/main/1.%20Analyze%20data%20for%20a%20digital%20media%20store.md) | I wrote multiple querries to explore the different tables that compose this database. Mostly, I focussed on some Sales and HR-related questions | data manipulation and insights extraction through joins and filtering. 
[Create a database for the deliveries of a restaurant](https://github.com/alexalra/Portfolio-Alejandro/blob/main/2.%20Create%20a%20database%20for%20the%20deliveries%20of%20a%20restaurant.md) | I built a database for the deliveries of a restaurant defining data types and establishing PK and FK to connect all tables. I then tested it by extracting some base insights from the tables | Database creation, manipulation, constraints creation, joins and data filtering. 
[(WIP)Analyze movie data through advanced SQL techniques] | I extracted insights from a movie database by leveraging more complex SQL scripts, including Windows functions, Funnels, Churns, etc. | Advanced SQL
