# (WIP) Analyze and report data for the HR Team.md

## üìå 1 Overview

In this project I will analyze a dataset with HR-related data from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adityaab1407/employee-productivity-and-satisfaction-hr-data?resource=download). This comprehensive dataset, "Employee Performance and Satisfaction Metrics Dataset", provides a holistic view of the workforce in an organization. It comprises various employee attributes, performance metrics, and job characteristics, enabling a wide range of analyses in the realm of Human Resources.

On this ocassion, I will use Google Sheets to analyze the data and create a report with answers to several questions posed by a potential HR Officer. 

This is the original dataset without edits
