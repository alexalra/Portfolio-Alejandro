## üìå 1 Overview

In this project I will analyze a database with data about movies I retrieved from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shahjhanalam/movie-data-analytics-dataset?resource=download). It contains an array of critical details including movie titles, rating trends over time, unique identifiers for each movie, production budgets, worldwide as well as domestic box office earnings, etc.

On this ocassion, I will use more advanced SQL techniques to extract insights from this dataset.

## üìê 2 Database structure

 Table  | Total rows   |  Total columns
------------- | ------------- | ------------------
IMDB | 117 | 52
earning | 117 | 3
genre | 351 | 2
