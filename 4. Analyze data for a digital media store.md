# üéπ Analyze data for a digital media store

## üìå 1 Overview

This project will explore multiple questions with regard to the database Chinook.db, which represents a digital media store. The database was retrieved from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/marwandiab/chinookdatabase). 

I explored the data in this database by asking questions related to the company's sales or HR in order to showcast my SQL skills.

5. What is the average duration of the tracks sold by the employee with higher sales?

<details>

  <summary>Answer</summary>

```
386867.45 is the average duration of the tracks sold by Jane Peacock

```

Code

To answer this question I created 2 subquerries.
The first subquerry (TABLE_1) returned the employee with higher sales.
The second subquerry (TABLE_2) returned the average duration of the tracks sold by every employee.


```sql
WITH TABLE_1 AS 

  (SELECT 
    E.FirstName NAME, 
    E.LastName LAST_NAME,
    SUM(I.total) TOTAL_SALES, 
    E.EmployeeId EMPLOYEE_ID 
  FROM 
    Invoice AS I
  JOIN 
    Customer as C
  ON 
    C.CustomerId = I.CustomerId
  JOIN 
    Employee as E
  ON 
    C.SupportRepId = E.EmployeeId
  GROUP BY 
    4
  ORDER 
    BY 3 DESC
  LIMIT 
    1),

TABLE_2 AS 

  (SELECT 
    AVG(T.Milliseconds) AVERAGE_DURATION, 
    E.FirstName NAME,
    E.LastName LAST_NAME
  FROM 
    TRACK as T
  JOIN 
    InvoiceLine as IL 
  ON 
    T.TrackId = IL.TrackId
  JOIN 
    Invoice as I
  ON 
    IL.InvoiceId = I.InvoiceId
  JOIN 
    Customer as C
  ON 
    C.CustomerId = I.CustomerId
  JOIN 
    Employee as E
  ON 
    C.SupportRepId = E.EmployeeId
  GROUP BY 
    2)

SELECT  
  TABLE_1.NAME, 
  TABLE_1.LAST_NAME,
  TABLE_2.AVERAGE_DURATION
FROM 
  TABLE_1
JOIN 
  TABLE_2
ON 
  TABLE_1.NAME = TABLE_2.NAME AND

4. Which different phone prefixes employees have?

<details>

  <summary>Answer</summary>
  

```
When I first tried to check the different prefixes, I noticed that not all of them where formated in the same way.

I tried substracting values to keep only the prefixes, but one of them was formated differently.

See the screenshot below. 
```
Code

```sql

SELECT
  SUBSTR(phone,4, 4) AS PREFIX
FROM
  Employee

```

 <summary>Answer</summary>
  

```
I made some changes in the code to take into account the uneven data.
I found that there are 2 different prefixes, 780 and 403.
```
Code

```sql

SELECT
  SUBSTRING(phone,5, 3) AS VALUES_1
FROM
  Employee
WHERE
  phone LIKE '+1%';

SELECT
  SUBSTRING(phone,4, 3) AS VALUES_2
FROM
  Employee
WHERE
  phone LIKE '1%';


```
