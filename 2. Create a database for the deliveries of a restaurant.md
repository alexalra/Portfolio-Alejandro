# ⚙️ Create a database for the deliveries of a restaurant

## 📌 1 Overview

In this project I will create a relational database from scratch, defining columns, tables, the way they relate to one another, and add constraints. This database is for the deliveries of a restaurant.

After it, I will explore the data in the database by asking some simple questions and allow the restaurant draw some conclusions from their operations.
