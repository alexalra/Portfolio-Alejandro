SQL-Practice - 2nd project
In this project I will create a relational database from scracth, defining columns, tables and the way they relate to one another. This database is for the deliveries of a restaurant.

After it, I will explore the data in the database by asking some simple questions and allow the restaurant draw some conclusions from their operations.

You can explore the following pages to see the databse, and the questions I posed, and the answered I obtained.
