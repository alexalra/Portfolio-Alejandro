# ‚öôÔ∏è Create a database for the deliveries of a restaurant

## üìå 1 Overview

In this project I will create a relational database from scratch, defining columns, tables, the way they relate to one another, and add constraints. This database is for the deliveries of a restaurant.

After it, I will explore the data in the database by asking some simple questions and allow the restaurant draw some conclusions from their operations.

## üìê 2 Entity Relation Diagram for the Database

The objective is to create a database with the following tables, data types, Primary Keys and Foreign Keys.

## üõ†Ô∏è 3 Database creation 

1. Define all tables and columns.
   
<details>

  <summary>Details</summary>
  

```
Let's first define all the tables and their columns, along with their constrains and different relations. 
```
Code

```sql

CREATE TABLE recipe (  
   id integer PRIMARY KEY UNIQUE,
   name varchar(30),
   ingredients varchar(100) NOT NULL,
   link varchar(20),
   price decimal 
);

CREATE TABLE customer (
   id integer PRIMARY KEY UNIQUE,
   name varchar(20),
   telephone char(10),
   allergens varchar(20),
   delivery boolean NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE orders (
   id integer PRIMARY KEY UNIQUE,
   recipe_id integer REFERENCES recipe(id),
   customer_id integer REFERENCES customer(id),
   price decimal, 
   comment varchar(100)
);

CREATE TABLE rating (
   customer_id integer REFERENCES customer(id),
   recipe_id integer REFERENCES recipe(id),
   rating decimal,
   PRIMARY KEY (customer_id, recipe_id)
);

CREATE TABLE customer_address (
   customer_id integer REFERENCES customer(id),
   street_name_number varchar(40),
   city varchar(15),
   state varchar(15)
);

```


</details>




2. Let's double-check that it's all correct.

<details>

  <summary>Details</summary>
  

```
Let's make sure that all the tables and PK/FK were created correctly. 
```
Code

```sql

SELECT 
    constraint_name, table_name, column_name
  FROM
    information_schema.key_column_usage
  WHERE
    table_name = 'orders';

SELECT 
    constraint_name, table_name, column_name
  FROM
    information_schema.key_column_usage
  WHERE
    table_name = 'customer';

SELECT 
    constraint_name, table_name, column_name
  FROM
    information_schema.key_column_usage
  WHERE
    table_name = 'recipe';

SELECT 
    constraint_name, table_name, column_name
  FROM
    information_schema.key_column_usage
  WHERE
    table_name = 'rating';

SELECT 
    constraint_name, table_name, column_name
  FROM
    information_schema.key_column_usage
  WHERE
    table_name = 'customer_address';

```

</details>

3. Let's input all the data into the tables.

<details>

  <summary>Details</summary>
  

```
Let¬¥s do it table by table.
```
Code

```sql


INSERT INTO recipe (id, name, ingredients, link, price)
   VALUES
   (13,'Smoked half chicken', 'Chicken and herbs', 'www.ourmenu13.com', 19.2),
   (12,'Pork belly with fries', 'Pork belly, fries, coleslaw and pickles', 'www.ourmenu12.com', 13.1),
   (5, 'BBQ Feast', 'Pork belly, chicken, fried chicken, fries and special mayo sauce', 'www.ourmenu5.com', 30.5),
   (6, 'Havana Sandwich', 'Roast pork, cheese, ham, pickles, bread and mustard', 'www.ourmenu6.com', 9.5),
   (11, 'Po boy', 'bread, shrimp, crawfish, mayo, hot sauce, capers and salad', 'www.ourmenu11.com', 9.2);

INSERT INTO customer (id, name, telephone, allergens, delivery)
VALUES 
   (3456, 'Robert', 003724567, 'none', TRUE),
   (5678, 'Agnes', 003729078, 'almonds', TRUE),
   (1456, 'David', 003724568, 'none', TRUE),
   (8907, 'Maria', 003721268, 'fish', FALSE),
   (1267, 'Geoff', 003722398, 'fish', TRUE),
   (3467, 'Juan', 003723562, 'pork', FALSE),
   (8897, 'Heili', 003723908, 'none', TRUE),
   (2347, 'Inna', 003729078, 'mayo', TRUE);

INSERT INTO orders (id, recipe_id, customer_id, price, comment)
VALUES
   (154, 13, 3456, 20.5, 'add spicy sauce'),
   (323, 12, 5678, 15.9, 'make it salty'),
   (643, 5, 1456, 38.7, 'no spicy'),
   (753, 6, 8907, 9.5, 'Extra sauce'),
   (532, 11, 1267, 12.9, 'No plastic wrapping'),
   (789, 12, 3467, 13.1, 'make it yummy'),
   (189, 6, 8897, 10.9, 'none'),
   (890, 5, 2347, 39.1, 'wrap it properly');

INSERT INTO rating (customer_id, recipe_id, rating)
VALUES
   (3456, 13, 7.8),
   (5678, 12, 8.9),
   (1456, 5, 8.0),
   (8907, 6, 6.2),
   (1267, 11, 7),
   (3467, 12, 10),
   (8897, 6, 5.4),
   (2347, 5, 10);

INSERT INTO customer_address (customer_id, street_name_number, city, state)
VALUES
   (3456, 'Kopli liinid, 13', 'Tallinn', 'Harjumaa'),
   (5678, 'Torupilli ots, 4, 12B', 'Tallinn', 'Harjumaa'),
   (1456, 'Alliksoo p√µik 6B', 'Tallinn', 'Harjumaa'),
   (1267, 'Kaluri tn 7','Tallinn', 'Harjumaa'),
   (8897, 'Kressi tee 89', 'Tallinn', 'Harjumaa'),
   (2347, 'Kuuli tn 7, 6D','Tallinn', 'Harjumaa');

4. Let's review the data on them.

<details>

  <summary>Details</summary>
  

```
Let's check that the data was correctly input into the tables.
```
Code

```sql

SELECT *
FROM recipe;

SELECT *
FROM orders;

SELECT *
FROM customer;

SELECT *
FROM rating;

SELECT *
FROM customer_address;
```
Example of 'recipe' table.

</details>

5. Check that PK and FK actually work.

<details>

  <summary>Details</summary>
  

```
Let's make a simple join to make sure that tables are properly connected. 
```
Code

```sql

SELECT
   recipe.ingredients, customer.allergens
FROM
   recipe
JOIN
   orders 
ON
   recipe.id = orders.recipe_id
JOIN
   customer
ON
   customer.id = orders.customer_id

```
It works like a charm!

</details>

6. Let's update the table constraints

<details>

  <summary>Details</summary>
  

```
Apparently, there are no constrains in the recipe table for the column 'price'.

Someone input a new recipe without a price.

I tried to add a constrain to prevent this from happening again but I would get an error afterwards.

That's because there were aleady NULL values in the table.

```
Code

```sql

INSERT INTO recipe (id, name, ingredients, link)
VALUES
   (49,'Rosemary focaccia', 'Flour, eggs, water, rosemary, yeast', 'www.ourmenu49.com');


ALTER TABLE
   recipe
ALTER COLUMN
   price
SET NOT NULL;

```
  

```
1) To work around this, I set up all NULL values to 0.

2) I ran again the query to add the constrain. It worked this time. Now nobody else will be able to leave this data field empty.

3) The current 0 values can also be changed manually, let's set up the focaccia price correctly.

```
Code

```sql

UPDATE
   recipe
SET
   price = 0
WHERE
   price IS NULL;


ALTER TABLE
   recipe
ALTER COLUMN
   price
SET NOT NULL;


UPDATE
   recipe
SET
   price = 17.8
WHERE
   name = 'Rosemary focaccia';



```
</details>


7. Let's add more constraints

<details>

  <summary>Details</summary>
  

```
We want to prevent customers from leaving ratings below 0.

Let's add a constrain so rating can only be 0 or bigger.

```
Code

```sql

ALTER TABLE rating
ADD CHECK (rating >= 0)

```
</details>


## ‚ùì 4 Questions

Let's ask some questions to explore that database and see how the deliveries of this restaurant are going.

1. Which recipe generated more revenues? 

<details>

  <summary>Answer</summary>
  

```
BBQ Feast
```
Code

```sql

SELECT
  recipe.name, SUM(orders.price)
FROM
  recipe
JOIN
  orders 
ON
  recipe.id = orders.recipe_id
GROUP BY
  1
ORDER BY
  2 DESC;
```

</details>


2. Who is the customer that is allergic to fish and placed an order with a recipe containing some sort of fish? 

<details>

  <summary>Answer</summary>
  

```
It was Geoff, who ordered Po boy, that contains crawfish.
```
Code

```sql

SELECT
  customer.name,
  recipe.name,
  customer.allergens,
  recipe.ingredients
FROM
  recipe
JOIN
  orders 
ON
  recipe.id = orders.recipe_id
JOIN
  customer
ON
  orders.customer_id = customer.id
WHERE
  recipe.ingredients LIKE '%fish%' AND customer.allergens = 'fish';

```

</details>

3. How much was every delivery?

<details>

  <summary>Answer</summary>
  

```
The orders.price is always higher than recipe.price. That is because orders.price includes the cost of the delivery. To calculate exactly how much every customer paid for the delivery we will deduct the recipe.price from every order.price and round the result. 
```
Code

```sql

SELECT
  orders.id,
  ROUND(orders.price - recipe.price,2) AS DELIVERY_PRICE
FROM
  recipe
JOIN
  orders
ON
  recipe.id = orders.recipe_id;


```

</details>

4. Which is the name of the customer that gave the highest rating?

<details>

  <summary>Answer</summary>
  

```
It was Inna, with 10. 
```
Code

```sql

SELECT
  customer.name,
  rating.rating
FROM
  customer
JOIN
  customer_address
ON
  customer.id = customer_address.customer_id
JOIN
  rating
ON
  customer_address.customer_id = rating.customer_id
ORDER BY
   2 DESC
LIMIT
  1;


```

</details>

5. Which customers requested food/recipes containing ingredients they are allergic to?

<details>

  <summary>Answer</summary>
  

```
At the beginning, I run the code below and it was giving me a erroneous result. It was always missing one of the customers, Juan, who is allergic to pork. For some reason, it was not being captured. Probably because WHERE statement is case sensitive and while the recipe had 'Pork belly' the customer was allergic to 'pork'.
```
Code

```sql

SELECT
  customer.name,
  recipe.ingredients,
  customer.allergens
FROM
  recipe
JOIN
  orders ON recipe.id = orders.recipe_id
JOIN
  customer ON customer.id = orders.customer_id
WHERE
  recipe.ingredients LIKE '%' || customer.allergens || '%'

```

  <summary>Answer</summary>
  

```
I sorted this issue by using LOWER before the column where the values were affected by the capital letters.

3 customers requested food containing ingredients they are allergic to.

Geoff, Juan and Inna
```
Code

```sql

SELECT
  customer.name,
  recipe.ingredients,
  customer.allergens
FROM
  recipe
JOIN
  orders ON recipe.id = orders.recipe_id
JOIN
  customer ON customer.id = orders.customer_id
WHERE
  LOWER(recipe.ingredients) LIKE '%' || customer.allergens || '%'

```
