# üßë‚Äçü§ù‚Äçüßë Analyze and report data for the HR Team.md

## üìå 1 Overview

In this project, I will analyze a dataset with HR-related data from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adityaab1407/employee-productivity-and-satisfaction-hr-data?resource=download). This comprehensive dataset, "Employee Performance and Satisfaction Metrics Dataset", provides a holistic view of the workforce in an organization. It comprises various employee attributes, performance metrics, and job characteristics, enabling a wide range of analyses in the realm of Human Resources.

On this ocassion, I will use Google Sheets to clean, organize and analyze the data and Looker Studio to create a report and provide answers to several HR-related questions.

## ‚ùì 3 Questions

1. Can you provide some basic figures on the amount of employees, their age, and gender distribution? 

2. How many hires did the company register per year?

3. Can you provide an interactive dashboard with the average salary per department and position? As well as the average salary per gender and other relevant figures? 
   
4. What is salary related to? seniority? productivity? the position itself?

5. Can you provide an interactive dashboard with all relevant information per department? Including their productivity, projects and the productivity of their top 5 employees. 


## üìä 4 Report

This is the [final report in Looker Studio.](https://lookerstudio.google.com/u/1/reporting/2272b48c-ed1b-481e-ad8e-7d390f9a20ec/page/7dw6D)

Page 1 - provides some general stats about number of employees, hires and gender.

Page 2 - provides figures about salary by position, department and gender.

Page 3 - visualizes the relation between salary and seniority.

Page 4 - visualizes the relation between salary and productivty.

This is [the spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Cy4XFhKRKTo6p3pu8g6XY3DOw66rmRvK3r3ZjNHQ9GU/edit?gid=760557872#gid=760557872) where I cleaned and formated the original data. I also added columns and calculations to the original spreadsheet here. This is the spreadsheet containing the data reflected in the report. 


## üí° 5 Insights 

A) The company counts with 200 individuals, 50% male and 50% female, with an age average of 35 y/o. The company has been hiring exponentially since 1998 with a major increase in 2018. Every position counts with a similar amount of male and female employees.

B) In terms of salary, Finance and IT are the departments with the highest salary. Managers and Team Leads are the positions with the highest remuneration. In terms of the pay gap company-wide, women earn 365.97 EUR yearly above the company average. However, when looking at more granular data like the pay gap per team (e.g. Marketing) we can appreciate that women earn almost 7K EUR more than men per year. 

C) Concerning the relationship between salary and seniority, the graph bar tends to decline towards the most recent year, meaning that senior employees generally earn more than junior ones. 

However, it is worth noting that the cadence of the bar between late the 90s and late 2000 is not very accentuated, denoting that employees with a 10-year difference of seniority in the company earn the same. 

We could also identify many other outliers, with employees hired in 2013 earning more than those hired in the late 90s. From 2013 onwards there seems to be a clearer correlation between seniority and salary, with newer employees earning less than older employees. In conclusion, it cannot be concluded that salary is only related to seniority. 

D) Concerning the relationship between salary and productivity, a new metric was calculated 'Salary from MAX (%). This represents the % of the salary of each employee compared to the company MAX salary. So if Donald Davis' salary is 35,169, and MAX salary is 119,895, his Salary from MAX (%) is 29.33%. 

When it comes to the results, the graph and table refute the idea that salary is explained by productivity. It's noticeable how many employees with very low productivity, have very high salaries, and employees with high productivity, have low salaries. 

Thus, we can conclude that salary is mostly linked to the position of each employee and slightly to seniority as explained in point C). 

E) Lastly, we can see that IT and Sales are the departments with higher productivity. Sales is also ahead in terms of projects per department, followed by Finance.
